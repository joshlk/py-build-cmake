# Package structure

For a detailed discussion of the directory structure of a Python package,
please see the README of [examples/minimal](https://github.com/tttapa/py-build-cmake/tree/main/examples/minimal).

For a more complete example that's closer to a real-world project, have a look
at the [tttapa/py-build-cmake-example](https://github.com/tttapa/py-build-cmake-example)
repository. It also contains continuous integration (CI) workflows to test and
deploy packages to the PyPI registry.
